<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>My name is Bridget Hartzheim and I am a first-year student at the McCombs School of Business. My major is currently unspecified but I am planning to declare a major in Marketing. I have interests in fashion, beauty, social media, and traveling. I aspire to have a career where I can connect my interests with my professional aspirtations. I hope to have a business career in marketing at a company in the fashion or beauty industry. Additionally, I love music, and I play clarinet in the Longhorn Band. The Longhorn Band has provided me with lifelong friends and has given me so many amazing opportunites, such as being able to attend and perform at the Sugar Bowl. I am also involved with the Women in Business Association, which has given me the opportunity to interact with successful businesswomen who are at the top of their respective industries. This has inspired me and has allowed me to recognize that I can also achieve a high level of success in my career. <br /><br /></p>
